/**
 An undirected edge intended to be used to construct undirected graphs.
 <p>The term <em>edge</em> is used in graph theory to describe a connection between a pair of vertices
 in either directed or undirected graphs.
 Consequently, this 'narrowing' of the term to only refer to a connection between a pair of
 vertices in an undirected graph is incorrect but seems to work reasonably well.</p>
