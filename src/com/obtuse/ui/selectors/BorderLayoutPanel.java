/**
 A JPanel derivative that uses the {@link BorderLayout} layout manager and blocks any attempt to any other layout manager instance, including a subsequent
 instance of {@code BorderLayout}.
 <p>This class exists because when a {@code BorderLayout} instance is given responsibility for a {@link Container}, it seems to treat any
 components already in the {@code Container} as being permanently invisible.</p>
 <p>Here's an example of code that illustrates this issue:</p>
 <blockquote><pre>static class A extends JPanel {

    protected A() {
       super();

        add( new JLabel( "this will never appear" ) );
        setLayout( new BorderLayout() );
        add( new JLabel( "this will also never appear because of what happens in B() below" ), BorderLayout.NORTH );

    }

}

static class B extends A {

    public B() {
        super();

        add( new JLabel( "this will also never appear because of what happens next" ), BorderLayout.SOUTH );

        // Assign a new BorderLayout instance to our JPanel.
        // This new BorderLayout instance will ignore the components that are already in the JPanel.

        setLayout( new BorderLayout() );

        add( new JLabel( "this will appear" ), BorderLayout.CENTER );

    }

    public static void main( String[] args ) {

        JFrame jf = new JFrame( "BorderLayout Issue Demo" );
        jf.setContentPane( new B() );

        // Make the frame big enough to easily see what's in it.
        // This line plays no 'functional' role in causing the issue being demonstrated to occur.
        jf.setMinimumSize( new Dimension( 200, 200 ) );

        jf.pack();
        jf.setVisible( true );

    }

}
 </pre>
 </blockquote>

     set out layout manager to a second {@code BorderLayout} layout manager instance, added more components in specified places.
