 Don't be tempted to make this class {@link GowingPackable}. Life is simpler if instances of this class are packed and unpacked as strings.
 The reason is a bit complicated but it boils down to the fact that instances of this class appear in a few places which, if this class is packable, it creates really ugly chicken-and-egg problems.
 Use {@link GowingPackableName} if you want a name that can pack and unpack itself.
