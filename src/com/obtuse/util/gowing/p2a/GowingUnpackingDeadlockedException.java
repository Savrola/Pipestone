/**
 Thrown when an unpacking operation fails because it became impossible to finish any of the remaining-to-be-finished entities.
 <p>Looking at the list of what is not yet finished is probably a good place to start when diagnosing the cause of this issue
 (see {@link #getUnfinishedEntityReferences()} for more info).</p>
 <p>Note that an instance of this class could refer to a fairly substantial amount of memory since the {@link GowingUnPacker}
 reference held by an instance of this class directly or indirectly refers to every {@link GowingPackable} entity unpacked
 since the unpacking operation started (note that this includes both finished and unfinished unpacked entities).
 Consequently, it would probably be wise to ensure that instances of this class are discarded when they are no longer useful.</p>
 <p>The {@code GowingUnPacker} referenced by this node has access to a great deal of potentially useful information (depending on
 how aggressive you want to be about diagnosing what went wrong). A few 'interesting' places to 'look' include:
 <ul>
 <li>Get the {@link GowingEntityReference}s for every {@link GowingPackable} that has been encountered during the unpack operation:
 <br>{@code this.getUnPacker().getUnPackerContext().getSeenEntityReferences()}</li>
 <li>Get a map containing every {@link GowingPackable} that has been encountered during the unpack operation:
 <br>{@code this.getUnPacker().getUnPackerContext().getSeenEntitiesMap()}</li>
 </ul>
 <p>If this exception is thrown then poking around inside the {@link GowingUnPacker} is unlikely to cause you any harm
 since the unpacking operation is done and dead.
 <u>On the other hand, it would be wise to be quite careful when poking around inside a {@code GowingUnPacker} instance either before or during
 its unpack operation (judicious use of the Gowing source code is more than merely advised).</u></p>
