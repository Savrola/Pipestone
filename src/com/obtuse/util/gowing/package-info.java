/**
 These packers are almost ready for primetime - please avoid using them for a while longer.
 <p/>
 This facility is named after John and Preston Robert Gowing who founded the famous (at least in Australia) Gowings
 chain of outfitters and retailers. I bought an Akubra hat at their then flagship store on the corner of Market and
 George Street in Sydney, Australia. The company eventually fell on hard times and ceased operation in 2006.
 <p/>
 Why "gowing" you ask? Because it fits with the notion that this facility is a packing facility and the Gowings stores
 were outfitters (i.e. they provided packing products).
