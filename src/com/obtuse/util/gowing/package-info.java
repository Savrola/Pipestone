/**
 <p>
 This facility is named after John and Preston Robert Gowing who founded the famous (at least in Australia) Gowing's
 chain of outfitters and retailers. I bought an Akubra hat at their then flagship store on the corner of Market and
 George Street in Sydney, Australia. The company eventually fell on hard times and ceased operation in 2006.</p>
 <p>
 Why "gowing" you ask? Because it fits with the notion that this facility is a packing facility and the Gowing's stores
 were outfitters (i.e. they provided packing products).</p>
